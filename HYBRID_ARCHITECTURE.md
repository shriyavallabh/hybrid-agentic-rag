# Hybrid Graph-Guided RAG Architecture Specification

## System Overview
A novel hybrid system combining Graph Counselor's 4-agent reasoning with comprehensive RAG capabilities for cross-model analysis and accurate knowledge retrieval.

## Core Components

### 1. Enhanced Knowledge Graph
- **Rich Nodes**: Detailed entities with full content summaries + RAG pointers
- **Intelligent Relationships**: Cross-model connections, methodology links, data dependencies
- **Node Types**: Model, Dataset, Metric, Method, Author, Organization, Concept, Performance
- **Relationship Types**: COMPARES_TO, BUILDS_ON, USES_DATASET, HAS_METRIC, DERIVED_FROM, OUTPERFORMS

### 2. Graph-RAG Integration Layer
- **Dual Retrieval**: Graph structure + RAG content
- **Smart Routing**: Graph for relationships, RAG for details
- **Context Merging**: Combine structural knowledge with rich content

### 3. 4-Agent Hybrid System
- **PLAN**: Graph structure analysis + RAG content planning
- **THOUGHT**: Cross-system reasoning about relationships and content gaps
- **ACTION**: Hybrid execution of graph traversal + targeted RAG retrieval
- **OBSERVATION**: Multi-modal analysis of structural and content results

### 4. Cross-Model Analysis Engine
